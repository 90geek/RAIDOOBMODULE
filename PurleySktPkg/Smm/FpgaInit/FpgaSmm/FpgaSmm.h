  @param[in]      DispatchHandle  The unique handle assigned to this handler by SmiHandlerRegister().
  @param[in]      Context         Points to an optional handler context which was specified when the
                                  handler was registered.
  @param[in, out] CommBuffer      A pointer to a collection of data in memory that will
                                  be conveyed from a non-SMM environment into an SMM environment.
  @param[in, out] CommBufferSize  The size of the CommBuffer.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS             The interrupt was handled successfully.
