    Input File:   SKX_MRC_for CTE.xlsx

Abstract:

    THIS FILE IS AUTO-GENERATED BY THE MMRC TOOL. DO NOT CHANGE THIS CODE.

    If edits are needed in this file, they must be done via the MMRC tool.

    If there is additional project-specific data required by the MMRC, it
    can be placed in MmrcProjectData.h, which is used for non-tool-generated
    data

    This file contains data structures for a particular piece of silicon.
    These structures are fed to MmrcLibraries.c, which use them to initialize
    memory.
